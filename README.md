## ‚ö° Getting Started
The easiest way to run Open Company Database is inside a Docker container. It works best with the most recent version of Docker, 26.0.0. You must be using Linux, Mac OS, or WSL on Windows.

```shell
docker compose up
```

For the first time, it takes about 2-3 minutes for all 3 containers to come up.

To interact with the sample database, login into Metabase running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/question#?db=2&table=92) via
- Email: `admin@opencompaniesdb.local`
- Password: `OpenCompanyDatabase@1`
